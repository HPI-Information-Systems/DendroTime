/** Compute the DTW distance between two time series.
 *
 * DTW is the most widely researched and used elastic distance measure. It mitigates
 * distortions in the time axis by re-aligning (warping) the series to best match
 * each other. A good background into DTW can be found in [1]_. For two series,
 * possibly of unequal length,
 * :math:`\mathbf{x}=\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\}` and
 * :math:`\mathbf{y}=\{y_1,y_2, \ldots,y_m\}` DTW first calculates
 * :math:`M(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})`, the :math:`n \times m`
 * point-wise distance matrix between series :math:`\mathbf{x}` and :math:`\mathbf{y}`,
 * where :math:`M_{i,j}=   (x_i-y_j)^2`.
 *
 * A warping path
 *
 * .. math::
 *     P = <(e_1, f_1), (e_2, f_2), \ldots, (e_s, f_s)>
 *
 * is a set of pairs of indices that  define a traversal of matrix :math:`M`. A
 * valid warping path must start at location :math:`(1,1)` and end at point :math:`(
 * n,m)` and not backtrack, i.e. :math:`0 \leq e_{i+1}-e_{i} \leq 1` and :math:`0
 * \leq f_{i+1}- f_i \leq 1` for all :math:`1 < i < m`.
 *
 * The DTW distance between series is the path through :math:`M` that minimizes the
 * total distance. The distance for any path :math:`P` of length :math:`s` is
 *
 * .. math::
 *     D_P(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}, M) =\sum_{i=1}^s M_{e_i,f_i}
 *
 * If :math:`\mathcal{P}` is the space of all possible paths, the DTW path :math:`P^*`
 * is the path that has the minimum distance, hence the DTW distance between series is
 *
 * .. math::
 *     d_{dtw}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}) =D_{P*}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}, M).
 *
 * The optimal warping path :math:`P^*` can be found exactly through a dynamic
 * programming formulation. This can be a time consuming operation, and it is common to
 * put a restriction on the amount of warping allowed. This is implemented through
 * the bounding_matrix structure, that supplies a mask for allowable warpings.
 * The most common bounding strategies include the Sakoe-Chiba band [2]_. The width
 * of the allowed warping is controlled through the ``window`` parameter
 * which sets the maximum proportion of warping allowed.
 *
 * @constructor Create a new configured instance to compute the DTW distance.
 * @param window          Window size for the Sakoe-Chiba bounding method. Default is 0.1.
 * @param itakuraMaxSlope Maximum slope as a proportion of the number of time points used to create
 *                        Itakura parallelogram on the bounding matrix. Must be between 0. and 1. Default is NaN.
